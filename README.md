# Auto Sleep/Shutdown Timer

This is a simple Python application that allows you to schedule an automatic sleep or shutdown of your Windows computer. You can set the timer in hours and minutes, choose the action (sleep or shutdown), and see a countdown. The countdown will turn red and play a sound when there are 10 seconds or less remaining.

## Features

- Set a timer in hours and minutes.
- Choose between shutdown and sleep actions.
- Display a countdown timer.
- Change countdown color to red when less than or equal to 10 seconds.
- Play a sound when less than or equal to 10 seconds.
- Button label changes from "Start" to "Stop" when the timer is running.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `playsound` package

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-sleep-shutdown.git
    cd auto-sleep-shutdown
    ```

2. Install the required Python package:

    ```sh
    pip install playsound
    ```

3. Place a sound file named `sound.mp3` in the project directory. This will be the sound played when there are 10 seconds or less left.

4. Convert the script into an executable using PyInstaller:

    ```sh
    pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed shutdown_timer.py
    ```

    - The `--onefile` flag tells PyInstaller to bundle everything into a single executable file.
    - The `--windowed` flag prevents a console window from appearing when you run the GUI application.

5. Move the `sound.mp3` file into the same directory as the generated executable (found in the `dist` directory). This ensures that the sound file is accessible when the application runs.

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```sh
python shutdown_timer.py
